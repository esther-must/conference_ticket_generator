## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
